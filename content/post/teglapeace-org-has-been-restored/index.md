After far too long, **the central website for the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation is restored**.

Rebuilding twenty years of Peace Races, International Olympic Committee Refugee Team training, the many graduating classes at the Tegla Loroupe Peace Academy, and the new initiatives for water during drought, livestock rebuilding, and flood resilience will take time, but we possess invaluable archives.

Our history is a history for all.
