Tegla Loroupe was given an opportunity to address a group of peace ambassadors who came from all over the world to attend The One Young World Peace Summit. This is one of the largest and most diverse network of peace leaders who come from all walks of life representing many races, religions, nationalities, and cultures:

In her speech she emphasized the  following

* The importance of standing on the common ground of universal moral principles, promoting reconciliation, overcoming barriers, and building peace.
* The importance of forming global networks that  represent the diversity of the human family and the different cultures.
* The importance of cooperation beyond the boundaries of religion, race, ethnicity, and nationality.
* And finally the practice of “living for the sake of others” as the guiding principle for building a global community
