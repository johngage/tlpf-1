### Paris Peace Forum

Tegla was invited to attend The 2018 Paris Peace Forum. This Forum is a new annual event championing international cooperation in order to solve global challenges and work towards lasting peace. Nearly 900 projects from 116 countries applied to have their efforts showcased at the event. Among them, 120 were selected. At the end of the forum, 10 of those projects were chosen by forum participants and the selection committee to receive special support from the Paris Peace Forum for a year, until the next edition of the forum in November 2019.

### Purpose of the Forum 

The forum is an independent association, created as a platform for high-level international discussion and to host direct dialogue between officials and civil society representatives on issues of global governance, combating climate change, providing assistance to Africa, managing the cybersphere at an international level, and countering information manipulation.
