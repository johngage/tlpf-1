## BOXING

“Over the last few years The Tegla Loroupe Boxing Club has put a lot of energy in developing this social project. It is indeed a great and historical day for the club ” Said Martin Maqio the Club’s Chairman

### Theme of the Race

The theme of the race was *Building Bridges and Inspiring Talents for Peace and Development*

The peace race brought together various reformed warriors from different warring communities in **North Rift** and from the neighboring country **Uganda**.

The peace race saw over 200 reformed warriors from the warring communities from **Karamojong** and **Sabei** in Uganda as well as the **Turkana**, **Pokot**, **Marakwet** from Kenya. These tribes frequently conflict over issues of land and cattle rustling.

**Inspector General Boinett** called on the communities in the region to embrace peace, pointing out that there was need for neighboring communities in the region to do away with the outdated culture of cattle rustling and banditry activities. **Boinnet** said the government will use alternative ways of solving disputes in the region and asked the leaders from the region to support government efforts.

“We want warriors to change and engage in other meaningful activities. The government is ready to assist them,” he said.

**Governor John Lonyagapuo** also urged his constituents to live together in peace and harmony. He promised to support the reformed warriors by working closely with them so as find meaningful activities that they can engage in. 

The communities that attended the race included Karamojong and Sabei from Uganda as well as the Turkana, Pokot and Marakwet from Kenya who have in the past engaged in cattle rustling.[](https://web.archive.org/web/20181118155913/http://teglapeacefoundation.org/2018/11/15/733/)
