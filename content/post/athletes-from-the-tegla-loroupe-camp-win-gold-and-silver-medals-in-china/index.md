Two Kenyan athletes, Hosea Simotwo and Japheth Kiptoon, scooped gold and silver medals at the recently concluded Beverly Round Lihu Lake International Half-Marathon in Wuxi City, China. The event was held on Sunday, 3rd November 2018. The two athletes are products of the  Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation training centre that hosts a number of refugee athletes who are supported by UNHCR Kenya.  This is a clear indication that inclusion can benefit both refugees and host community members!
